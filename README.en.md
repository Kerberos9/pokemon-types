# Pokémon Type Helper

Pokémon Type Helper is a lightweight webapp to easily find vulnerabilities on any type combination. For example, if you're fighting against a Rayquaza, you should put 'Flying' and 'Dragon' on the type selectors, and you would find Ice is really effective (x4) and grass is really bad (1/4).

## Live version

If you only care about using the app, you can just go to the [live version](https://pokemon-types.com/).

## Run it yourself

If you want to run it locally, or if you want to develop something about it, you just need to clone the repo, and run `npm install` to get everything ready. After that, if you want to work on it, use `npm run dev` to start a local development server, or use `npm run build && npm start` to run a local production build.

## Planned features

- ✓~~Pokémon selector, so you can just put the name of the pokémon and it will fill the types~~
